<p>This Halloween lets connect and add some pumpkin spiced IoT to our holiday decorations. Join Sam and Jim as we add our own tech twists to some jack-o'-lanterns. Come explore different ways you can add spooky lighting with programmable LED’s, add some music to set the theme, use sensors to make the experience react to people that get near it, and even connect it to the cloud for remote control. If you’ve been looking for a fun way to jump into learning about the Internet of Things this event was designed for you!</p>

<p><strong>Jim Bennett, Microsoft</strong></p>
<p>Jim does things with IoT and Azure in the Developer Relations team at Microsoft, mainly creating content for students and faculty to help them be successful with Microsoft technologies. He’s British, so sounds way smarter than he actually is, and is happy he moved to Redmond in time to be locked down at home and not see the office he came to work in, or the places he wanted to visit. In the past he’s lived in 4 continents working as a developer in the mobile, desktop, and scientific space. He&rsquo;s spoken at conferences and events all around the globe, organised meetup groups and communities, and written a book on mobile development.</p>
<p>He also hates and is allergic to cats, but has an 8-year-old daughter who loves cats, so he has 2 cats.</p>
