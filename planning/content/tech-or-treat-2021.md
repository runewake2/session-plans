This Halloween lets connect and add some pumpkin spiced IoT to our holiday decorations. Join Sam and Jim as we add our own tech twists to some jack-o'-lanterns. Come explore different ways you can add spooky lighting with programmable LED’s, add some music to set the theme, use sensors to make the experience react to people that get near it, and even connect it to the cloud for remote control. If you’ve been looking for a fun way to jump into learning about the Internet of Things this event was designed for you!
